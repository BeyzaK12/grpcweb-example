# GopherJS over Improbable gRPC Web to gRPC backend
An example implementation of a client and a server using the Improbable gRPC Web implementation
and the GopherJS gRPC Web bindings.

Currently functional, but the generated client protofile is manually written
pending some more work on [protoc-gen-gopherjs](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/protoc-gen-gopherjs).
